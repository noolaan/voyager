An "advanced" Discord moderation bot, even if it wasn't exactly advanced, it was a moderation bot that had some larger plans in mind. 
With this being a hobby project in mind, I never realy got around to it as much as I should have.

Decided to make it open-source for other people to take reference.

End-user documentation can be found [here](https://voyager-1.gitbook.io/voyager/). 
You don't think I would document/comment my code, would you?
